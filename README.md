# Obsidian Plugin - Select Files for Move

Select Files for Move is an Obsidian plugin that provides a new method for moving files and folders:

1. Right click a file or folder that you want to move, choose 'Select file/folder for move' in the context menu.
2. Right click the folder you want to move selected items into, choose 'Move selected items into folder' in the context menu.



## Development

Install dependencies and build the plugin:

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm run build
```

The build writes `main.js` and `manifest.json` to `./dist/`.

Then symlink the `./dist/` folder from the Obsidian plugin folder.

```sh
ln -s <path to ./dist/> folder-database
```

If you want to sync your plugins, you will need to copy the folder instead of symlinking.

### Creating a release

Run below command to create and upload new version tag. This makes use of `npm version` [lifecycle hook](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-version) and the script.

```sh
pnpm version 0.1.0
git push origin main 0.1.0
```
